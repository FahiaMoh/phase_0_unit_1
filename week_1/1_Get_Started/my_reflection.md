## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

<!-- Add your reflection here. Remove the comment markers -->
* It was relatively straight forward to setup the git and GitHub as I already had a GitHub account prior.  What I took from this was the distinctive differences between Git and GitHub that I previously had no idea existed.  
* Git is like a local repository of data, which can be anything from lines of code, essays, and other documents that are saved locally on your computer and can be accessed from only there.  GitHub does something similar except it allows for you to store your data remotely online that can be accessed from anywhere given that you have a GitHub account and an internet connection
* Version Control is a way for you to keep track of the changes made on a file.  It saves all the changes amde and you have made them and continues to do something like a back up of the file at that given time.  GitHub allows you to see what changes were made, when they were made, and by whom all at one time.  This is version control and GitHub uses it as it is crucial for creating and organizing code. 
* Developers need to use version control for times like when you're doing a group project and constant revisions are done.  Version control allows you to be able to keep track of the changes, who's made them and this allows for a clear concise method of organization as well as creating the right project. It makes perfect sense to me and I think it's very useful to use especially if there is a group involved using the same resources as you and you guys are building something together. 
* A lot of this makes sense, I can see the usefulness of Git and GitHub for developers and I think it is a powerful tool.
