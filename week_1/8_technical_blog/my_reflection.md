Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

*Over the course of the week I have gotten a lot more comfortable as well as confident with HTML/CSS and creating this blog template and writing a blog post was fun.  I didn't find it cumbersome or tedious and I only ran into a few problems that took a bit of thinking and analyzing til I found my often silly mistakes. I felt good about how the content looked and I wasn't able to create a full border all the way around the content as it was constantly giving me trouble.
