* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

*I had quite a few questions, like how to fit the borders, how I could get something to show up on a specific spot
*I struggled with the div classes and Id's and trying to understand that css and html work hand in hand and i had to relate the code to the html to make something show up.  I realized how smoothly they integrate and figured it out.
*While reading about the borders i realized when my window wasn't maxed they borders overlapped and it only was proportionate in full screen, I tried to figure out why this happened but I couldn't find anything on the resources so I googled the issue and I was able to pinpoint the issue after some trial and error.  
*I am way more confident coming out of it than I was going into it, It seemed overwhelming but when I took it step by step it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought.
*I enjoyed seeing the syntax turn into a live site, I could see what i was building coming into fruition.  It made the process a whole lot more fun.
*I found the margins and the small adjustments of getting everything to fit on screen by pixel count really tedious and time consuming.
