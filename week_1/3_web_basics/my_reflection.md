*I learned the distinctive differences between websites and webapps and that they do very different things, websites are static and webapps are more interactive and have a lot more function than the standard website
*For me, I had to take the line i was supposed to paste into sublimetext and split it and seperate the lines instead of keepig it on one line becuase it kept giving me a 404, im not sure if that is an issue solely based on the syntax or if it was just a mishap.
*It was cool to see what syntax is used to show words on the webpage, im excited to learn more and create more interactive webpages. 
*I had a split second "brain fart" so to speak when writing the syntax and wasn't aware i needed to put more in because on the lesson it said to copy and paste that one line but when i did it gave me a 404, so i looked at the picture and saw that there was more added into the syntax.
*Nope, the information provided was more than sufficient and I easily grasped the basic concepts from what was provided.
