* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* At the top right beside your name there's a + drop down menu, click on that and you will see an option that says "New Repository".  It will take you to a new window where you type in the info of your new repository.  Open the github app installed on your computer and click on your name on the left and it will show your name for the repository.  Right click this and hit clone to this computer.  
* Open source software means you have access to the source code as well as the overall product.  This allows for the overall product to be continuously edited indefinitely by various people collectively.
* I think Open Source is great, especially for things that require extensive privacy i.e. internet browsers, cloud software etc etc.  
* With licenses, you do not give away your rights to the work.  It only gives permissions for others to continue to use that work.
* I solidified the concepts of licenses and the various kinds and their uses.  I did not know prior to this what each one meant or their roles in many applications.
* The resources given to me gave me more than enough information to work with.
