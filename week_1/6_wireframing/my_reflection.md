* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

*I learned that user experience is directly correlated with seemless design. In order to to get the best user exp you have to provide a design that allows for streamlined navigation, easy viewing, and concise spacing for the information/product/service,etc. 
*I think it's cool to understand how the planning goes and how something is implemented that helps the end users experience, I wouldn't say i loved doing it but it was definitely something I should know.
*I am very confident with each of the learning competencies and am fully able to explain wireframing and the benefits to it and how to wireframe an existing site.
*I think the information presented was the most enjoyable part for me because the design thinking portion really made me shift my perspective and to remember to consciously make an effort to be more inquisitive. 
*Nothing was really tedious in this challenge.
