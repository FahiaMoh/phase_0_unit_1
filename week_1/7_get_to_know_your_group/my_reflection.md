2. Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

2. It made me connect with them on a more personal level to hear their insecurities and fears going into dbc, I share the same. I have an idea of what to expect but I truly have no idea what is in store for us so I am excited but also afraid.  It felt good to know that people shared the same feelings and it reminded me we we're all doing this together and we will grow as devs and as people together and it made it feel more like a community as well.
