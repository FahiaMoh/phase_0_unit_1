# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

*I think web standards are good because they ensure that all browsers display the website properly without having to spend time on rewriting the code. Search engines also index websites that follow web standards and this means that they show up on their search engines much quicker, they also are easier to convert to other formats.  
*I like that the new HTML5 elements shorten the process of getting to the same outcome.  It is far more productive to use <header> instead of <div class="header"></div>
*reset.css is necessary because it provides a blank canvas so that you can add your own styles.  You start with a blank canvas therefore you aren't modifying or changing anything from the beginning.  Compatability issues are minimized because you gradually add on styles and other aspects instead of starting with something already.  
*I used google chrome, on inspection it was comparitively different on internet explorer. I don't think this is bad as it should be relative to the browser and if it wasn't then the margins and sizing would be off on different browsers.  So I think it's good to have an adaptable webpage. 
*I went on W3schools to solidify concepts like the @fontface because I wasn't really understand how I could implement it.  I also went online to understand the significance behind resetting the CSS.
