# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

*The Document Object Model(DOM) provides a way for you to see the structure of the document and you're able to change the style, content and document structure through the DOM.
*The wordpress sites used scripts and other languages besides HTML/CSS, whereas, my webpage only used HTML/CSS.  
*The Chrome Web Tools was certainly not a pain to work with but it was definitely interesting to use and see how much you can manipulate webpages from the dev tools.

*The resources provided gave me enough info to work with.  

What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

*A problem I faced was during the challenges on codeschool, it wouldn't give me a check for a step that I finished and I don't know if that was the site or not but it happened a few times and I had to skip the step even though I had it complete.  Besides that I didn't run into any problems that the videos didn't answer. 
*I learned a few new skills because the whole inspect element option was completely new to me.  I had no idea you could do so much on the browser.  This is so much more efficient and instead of constantly saving and refreshing the page you can make live changes and continually add onto the webpage.
*The learning curve on the Devtools isn't too steep so most of these new concepts that I've learned are not too difficult to grasp and implement fluidly.  So I am quite confident in the learning competencies.
*Nothing really jumped out at me as being tedious, it seems that the constant refreshing and saving to check the changes part was incredibly tedious and that has been taken out by impelementing the devtools on google chrome.  I think that this minimizes errrors because u can directly see what you're changing and see what it does live instead of doing small changes and then hitting save and forgetting which one made the whole site flip sideways and turn blue or something.
