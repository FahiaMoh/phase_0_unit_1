# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: <!-- Website URL here (remove comment) -->

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

*I learned that there is a lot ot accomodate in terms of design and user experience in order to provide a way for your users to interact/buy whatever it is you're putting on the site.  Also I wasn't sure how deep I was to go into the design because it proved to be tough to actually get the webpage to be responsive on more than one type of browser(and whether it was at max screen or not). So it's kind of unnerving to not know where to stop or if I have enough. 
*I like to see the end result of design and trying to create a platform that provides optimal user experience. Some of the tedious(not so fun) parts can get frustrating, but at the same time the process in itself is fun.  It was awesome diagnosing the problem and fixing it. I also learned more fixing the problem and taking it apart. 
*I spent more time on this than I'd care to admit, I was keen on fixing my problem wiht the browser compatability.  The issue arose when my window wasn't maxed and I saw my texts floating at every corner. I tried manipulating the margins, making them float, I thought I did everything.  But when I looked closely at my css I noticed I used px and % vs ems.  I went back to the resources given to me and I saw that for resolution issues, using ems for everything is best. SO I went back and changed everything to ems and converted the pixels to ems and saw that it did in fact work after spending so long trying to move everything around and seeing that it still bounced around! I figured this out after takign a break and just letting myself cool off after not figuring it out for a bit and when I came back, it was much easier to diagnose the issue.  It felt refreshing that the AHA moment came after so much trouble. 
* getting it to be responsive and compatible to multiple browsers was tricky for me so next time i'd like to create more fluidity on my webpage and I didn't get to use my first wireframe idea because it posed too complicated for me especially with the resolution issues.  I posted both wireframes to show how i did it after. 
*I think a common mistake(that I've noticed in all my css files) is the mixing of pixels and percentages in the css.  This really messes up the resolution and positioning.
