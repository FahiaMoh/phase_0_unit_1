# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

*I think responsive web design is good practice and I do like it because it allows for adaptability.  With all the different phones,tablets and monitors out there I think it's really important to have an adaptable, responsive webpage that can provide optimal viewing experience on any technology.
*I think with the advent of smartphones and tablets brought more adaptive design to fit the small screens of cell phones.  Webpages were built to change and looked completely different vs the monitor version of the webpage.  With new technology I think we would see a lot more readily adaptable webpages that can fluidly traverse different technologies to provide optimal user experience. 
*I think for true responsive design, you need to accommodate all sorts of people and possibly redesign the page to have bolder, larger designs but still have the same effect as your regular webpage. 
*I think one of the largest things that resonated with me was the emphasis on fluidity and adaptability.  This, I think is an important aspect of design because of hte various technologies out there and the many different resolutions.  You can't afford to not be adaptable. 
*I read a really good blog that explained the conecpt of responsive web design to get a better grasp of the concept and it did really well in explaining and highlighting key points. Link: http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/12/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/
