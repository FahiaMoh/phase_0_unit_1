* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?


* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

*I think my biggest time management challenge would be balancing work and phase 0.  This week I worked a little over 30 hours.  I knew coming into phase 0 I'd have to have a tight schedule to make sure I didn't fall behind(as of now i haven't really). I usually work in the evenings(and sometimes mornings) So I always divide my time between work and phase 0.

* How will you combat that? 

*I always leave time for phase 0 work depending on my shift that day. So if i'm working 3-11, I'd wake up early in the morning and get done what I can before heading to work.  THis isn't really an issue for me but it can get in the way especially if I'm stuck on a problem and I have to head to work which sucks.

* What techniques will you try?

*When I'm stuck on a problem I can't for the life of me figure out, I always just leave my desk and do something for a bit to clear my head.  Whether it be read a book, head to the gym. It always helps me and never fails to clear my head and revisit the issue and calmly pick apart the problem to diagnose where it's coming from.  I've also been meditating for roughly 7 months and that in itself has helped me beyond just in work but in every possible facet of my daily life. 

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

* I have a strict schedule since I'm funding this whole thing myself, I can't afford to work less hours and I've fallen behind on pairing so I'll have to set aside time to pair up this week and get the required amount.
