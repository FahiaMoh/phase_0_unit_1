I want to..
	1. create a variable called "sum" that will represent the sum of the numbers within the given range. 
	2. Then, have that variable return the sum of all the numbers within the oddLengthArray. 
	3. Then return the sum of all the numbers within the evenLengthArray for the third test. 
	4. For the fourth test, I want to create a variable called "mean" that will represent the average of the given range of numbers.  
	5. This mean variable will return the average of all the the numbers within the oddLengthArray.  
	6. This will also be done with the average of all the numbers within the evenLengthArray
	7. create a variable called median that will represent the median of the given ranges.
	8. This variable will return the median value of all numbers within the oddLengthArray.
	9. Then, the variable will return the median of all numbers within the evenLengthArray.

// Reflection
// What was this experience like?
// I've never heard of a user story before so researching it and seeing its benefits to structuring the process for going about a project.
// It was interesting to see everyone take a portion of a project and take the finished product and incorporate all our work into one.

// Was your group successful in passing the tests?
// My group did well in passing every test and we all did well on our parts of the challenge

// What did you learn about writing user stories, pseudocoding, writing code, refactoring, etc.?
// I learned that there was a process in working towards a solution/project. This involves many steps and I felt this was a very
// organized, clean method of going about a problem.  It ensured we thought everything through and walked through it step by step.

// What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
// In writing the user story, I didn't find a problem.  I was focused on providing a clear, set of instructions that would be
// easily implemented into pseudocode.

// What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

// What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?

// Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
// This entire challenge showed various new skills about going through a solution and I think these are not tedious or redundant because
// it is easily scalable to more complex projects that require clear, defined set of steps and ways to go about it. 

// How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
// I felt I got a great grasp on the learning competencies and how each step is necessary in the overall solution

// Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
// Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
// Neither of these really describe how this was for me.  It wasn't either enjoyable or tedious. 
// I did however, gain a new perspective on problem solving and how developers go through tackling a problem.
