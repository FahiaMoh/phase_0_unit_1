I want to..
	1. create a variable called "sum" that will represent the sum of the numbers within the given range*. 
	2. Then, have that variable return the sum of all odd numbers within the oddLengthArray. 
	3. Then return the sum of all even numbers within the evenLengthArray for the third test. 
	4. For the fourth test, I want to create a variable called "mean" that will represent the average of the given range of numbers.  
	5. This mean variable will return the average of all the odd numbers within the oddLengthArray.  
	6. This will also be done with the average of all the even numbers within the evenLengthArray
	7. create a variable called median that will represent the median of the given ranges.
	8. This variable will return the median value of all numbers within the oddLengthArray that are odd.
	9. Then, the variable will return the median of all even numbers within the evenLengthArray.
