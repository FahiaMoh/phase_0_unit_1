## Release 5: Reflection

*What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?

I had to re read and make sure I understood what each of the commands did as i've had no experience with Git, this was something new to me 

*What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I had to google a git command list to get a better understand of what each command does

*What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?

Upon reading what each command does, I found two to share a very similar description(git rm, git reset).  This confused me because it seemed redundant, but upon trying each one I saw they did very distinctive things despite having very similar descriptions.  

*Did you learn any new skills or tricks?

I guess learning a new method of pushing my work to my github that is faster and quicker is a new trick 

*How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I fully understand how to use and navigate Git as well as what each command is used for

*Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?

Learning a new method that is actively used by developers was cool, I find it's a lot quicker and more efficient to do everything on git

*Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

Nothing was really tedious about this challenge, I liked learning new methods and seeing what works for me
